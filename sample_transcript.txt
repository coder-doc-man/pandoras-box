28/02/25, 21:33 - +91 98704 61075: Sir according to this .. answer 1b ..n grade 2 is low grade .. so why not intermediate
28/02/25, 21:34 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: the stage is 1A
28/02/25, 21:35 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: 1B needs to have more than 50% invasion
28/02/25, 21:35 - +91 98704 61075: Myometrium invasion % is not mentioned sir..
28/02/25, 21:36 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: thats true ... it may be done to confuse you..it cannot be 1B unless >50% is mentioned

28/02/25, 21:50 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: radical hysterectomy+ node dissection alone is not enough, it should be accompanied by partial radical vaginectomy...

01/03/25, 20:51 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: LMS usually in stage 1
01/03/25, 21:01 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: Uterine Carcinosarcoma - although early stage is nearly 50% and advanced stage is 50%, looking at individual stages, commonest is stage 1

03/03/25, 23:52 - +91 98704 61075: Single layer of flattened cell .. surroundings primary oocyte .. but that's not in option..
03/03/25, 23:52 - +91 94192 21309: Yes
04/03/25, 00:24 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: ideally that should ve been answer..option 2 is not right, as once multilayers are formed then they are not flattened pregranulosa cells, but cuboidal granulosa cells..option 3 and 4 are definitely wrong as primordial follicle don't contain secondary oocyte...
so the closest option is 1..although the cells are single layer flattened pregranulosa cells, they later on become cuboidal single layer, then multilayer granulosa cells..
04/03/25, 00:25 - +91 98704 61075: Ty u sir

04/03/25, 14:23 - +91 98704 61075: Sir can you explain statement 2 ..
05/03/25, 10:51 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Answer 3 is more appropriate.
Option 4 regarding cost of trigger agent is not a main recommendation by ESHRE
05/03/25, 10:58 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: You need to know details of duo stim.
Conventional stim is follicular phase
Duo stim means both follcular stim foll by oocyte retrieval foll by rpt stim in luteal phase and one more oocyte retrieval.
These are generally for cancer patients and for those with diminished ovarian reserve.
And some papers showed that luteal phase stim embryos were better than the foll phase stim embryos. This is not substantiated however. 
The concept of luteal stim came thus. But then obviously you can't do fresh embryo transfer here. 
So they mentioned non transfer cycles.

After how long can definitive management be done after these
12/03/25, 18:21 - +91 70060 10147: Hcg
12/03/25, 18:41 - +91 70060 10147: @919947088881  sir
12/03/25, 18:52 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: is there a question like that?

12/03/25, 19:35 - +91 70060 10147: I saw 2 ques like that one was in rvf if high up after colostomy how much time repair that was 3 weeks
But i cudnt find an answer to this one but there was a question like that in one of the q banks
12/03/25, 22:19 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: do you mean to ask when will you actually repair fistula after colostomy?
12/03/25, 22:21 - +91 70060 10147: No no sir
I case of recurrence if there is central recurrence a pelvic exentration is done but if there is vvf /rvf and colostomy is then then after how long can the radiation be given
12/03/25, 22:22 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: for that you don't have clear cut guidelines... usually the earliest that they give further treatment is after 3 weeks of surgery
12/03/25, 22:22 - +91 70060 10147: Okay sir thankyou
12/03/25, 22:23 - +91 70060 10147: Also sir in case of a fistula if found early then repair immediately 
But if more than 24 hrs then is it 6 weeks or 3 months given different everywhere
12/03/25, 22:28 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: i too feel the answer should be 3
12/03/25, 22:29 - +91 98704 61075: Thank you sir
12/03/25, 22:30 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: 3 months

14/03/25, 01:40 - +91 98704 61075: I mean sir why answer 3 .. why not 1 ?
14/03/25, 01:59 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: breast development and vaginal bleeding without pubarche or excessive growth, points to a peripheral precocious puberty... possibly ovarian cyst or adrenal lesion or exogenous hormones..

for peripheral precocious puberty-- hormone suppression is not the first step... ideally you need to measure FSH, LH, Estradiol levels and monitor ultrasounds very 6 weeks or 3 months, if suspicious of ovarian or adrenal lesions..
14/03/25, 02:01 - +91 98704 61075: Ty u sir

15/03/25, 01:35 - +91 84471 33819: Sir we will assume > 50% invasion in this ?
15/03/25, 01:36 - +91 84471 33819: Because if < 50% then low risk
15/03/25, 01:36 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: look for the word deep myometrial invasion...
usually the question will be more clear...
15/03/25, 01:37 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: of nothing is mentioned and only myometrial invasion is told.. then ot has to be an intelligent guess ..
15/03/25, 01:37 - +91 84471 33819: So in this q deep is not mentioned then we can mark low?

15/03/25, 02:25 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: *Recommendations* *for High intermediate risk* 
► Adjuvant brachytherapy can be recommended to decrease 
vaginal recurrence (II, B).
► EBRT can be considered for substantial LVSI and for stage II (I, B). ► Adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered, especially for high- grade and/or substantial LVSI (II, C). ► Omission of any adjuvant treatment is an option (IV, C). ► When molecular classification is known, POLEmut and p53abn have specific recommendations (see respective recommendations for low- and high- risk).
15/03/25, 02:27 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: **Recommendations* for high intermediate risk without nodal staging done* 
 ► Adjuvant EBRT is recommended, especially for substantial LVSI and/or for stage II (I, A).
 ► Additional adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered, especially for high- grade and/or substantial LVSI (II, B). 
► Adjuvant brachytherapy alone can be considered for high- grade LVSI negative and for stage II grade 1 endometrioid carcinomas (II, B). 
► When molecular classification is known, POLEmut and p53abn have specific recommendations (see respective recommendations for low- and high- risk)
15/03/25, 02:27 - +91 98704 61075: So answer should be b na .. sir in this case
15/03/25, 02:27 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: no...a
15/03/25, 02:27 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: because LVSI or stage II are not there...
15/03/25, 02:28 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: hope it is clear..
15/03/25, 02:29 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: you may give ebrt also...but in the question they have asked to reduce recurrence and to reduce adverse effects.. vaginal brachy reduces recurrence risk..

18/03/25, 06:24 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: ERA tests implantation window.
We give estrogen followed by 5 days of progesterone.
Then take a biopsy.
If its receptive, we go for Blastocyst transfer after 5 days of progesterone.
If it is " pre receptive", then more days of progesterone is needed( 6/ 7 days) for blast transfer. Similarly if its post receptive ( excess prog induced changes), we give 3/4 days of prog only for a blast ( Day 5 embryo) transfer
18/03/25, 06:28 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Here the option is incorrect. It should be less days of prog exposure. 
Option A ( fresh ET,)
or option B ( frozen ET later) are also partially correct. 

If reprat ERA option is there, it should be done with 3 days of prog in cases of postreceptive reports and 7 days of prog in pre receptive reports. To get the optimal day.
 If repeat ERA is not an option, go with ET with lesser days of progesterone
18/03/25, 06:30 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Correct answer is A, ICM Quality. Both ICM and trophectoderm are imp, but ICM is a better predictor

18/03/25, 06:39 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Best choice is B.
Discard multinucleated ones.
If all are multinucleated, then the other option is partially correct. 
But, its generally not possible to identify multinucleation after day 2. So better discard. 
If all multinucleated, grow till blast stage, only good ( probably) ones will survive till day 5 and then take a chance.
18/03/25, 06:42 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Bromocriptine is the best choice. 
But the "most effective" can be gonadotropins as bromocriptine will take time and might not entirely reverse anovulation. 
The answer depends on the person setting the question.
18/03/25, 06:46 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Best next step is IVF as tubal block may be prox or distal.
Only prox block is treatable by canulation. And that too, results are not very good. 
So best is IVF.

If question is a young woman, good male factor, married since 1-2 yrs, HSG block, cannulation could be tried as NEXT step. 
But next BEST step is usually IVF
18/03/25, 06:50 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Clear cut off is not much popular.
Generally minimum 7-10 days of estrogen exposure is needed.
We can take an arbitary value of around 300-400 pg as minimum. 
High values of OHSS ranges can impair implantation.
But high prog value on day of trigger ( > 1.5 ng) is more detrimental for implantation as it can cause premature progestational changes and shift the window of implantation
18/03/25, 07:02 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: lower urethra - stage 2
upper 2/3rds - stage 3..
18/03/25, 07:04 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: sertoli leydig cell tumour - most common virilising ovarian tumour 
but if question is in a postmenopausal lady, then commoner would be leydig cell tumour

18/03/25, 08:46 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: in this C s answer...you dont require 1cm of cervical canal..even 5-10mm of tumour free area from the internal os may be considered for trachelectomy
18/03/25, 08:47 - +91 89799 42249: But preferred is 1cm, right sir?
18/03/25, 08:47 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: yes ... but here in the question "atleast 1cm" is not right

18/03/25, 08:55 - +91 89799 42249: Confused sir , lateral spread is not considered so should be 1a1 ..but width is 8mm and it says invasive so less than 2 cm
18/03/25, 08:57 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: dont consider the width, only depth of invasion..
18/03/25, 08:57 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: which book are these questions from?
18/03/25, 08:58 - +91 89799 42249: Williams gynaecology

18/03/25, 09:01 - +91 84471 33819: Margins positive
18/03/25, 09:01 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: are the margins positive for cancer?
18/03/25, 09:01 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: what if the margin was cin1?
18/03/25, 09:02 - +91 89799 42249: Ecc is also positive sir
18/03/25, 09:03 - +91 89799 42249: Still we will do re excisiom
18/03/25, 09:03 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: that was before cone, right?
18/03/25, 09:03 - +91 89799 42249: Margins should be clear of invasive and pre invasive ds
18/03/25, 09:04 - +91 84471 33819: Cin1 , no repeat conization as low grade lesion <This message was edited>

19/03/25, 13:11 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: were there any options of a surgical approach other than hysterectomy?
19/03/25, 13:12 - +91 70060 10147: Sir i just remember these 2 options because i marked hysterectomy because these are chemo resistant cancers
19/03/25, 13:14 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: these are controversial  scenarios...
ideally hysterectomy is to be done for pstt...
but if you had some other options like uterine wedge resection or some sorts..then maybe that..

25/03/25, 12:50 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: First line Letrozole ( or CC)

Second line Either Gonadotropins ( not GnRH) or Drilling. 
Drilling vs Gonadotropins is a big topic. 
Nowadays, Gonadotropin is more preferred. 
Usual protocols are chronic low dose protocol, low dose protocol 

Third line IVF
Usual protocol is GnRH antagonist protocol

CC resistane

Usually letrozole
CC plus Metformin ( only if abnormal glucose tolerance)
Gonadotropins ( chances of ohss high)
Drilling last option
25/03/25, 13:03 - +91 70060 10147: Okay sir

28/03/25, 15:38 - +91 89799 42249: @919249426575 sir is there any benefit of fet over fresh cycle other than ohss prevention.
28/03/25, 16:34 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Better implantation in a group of patients.
Fresh cycle, elevated steroid hormones might impair implantation potential.
However, now the evidence is that fresh and frozen ET doesnt have much difference in outcome. 
( Based on e Freeze trial )
28/03/25, 16:35 - +91 89799 42249: Thankyou sir
28/03/25, 20:51 - Dr Deepak Bose Obgyn Marrow: All the best to all of you..for your exam ...

28/03/25, 21:03 - Dr Ramesh Marrow Obg Infertility: Nothing like maximum numbers..
Ideal is to get TMSC (total motile sperm conc) more than 10 million/ ml.
Best and standard is double density gradient method even if its little bit costly..

Most common is usually swim up technique being cheaper
28/03/25, 21:03 - +91 70060 10147: Thankyou sir
28/03/25, 21:04 - +91 70060 10147: Sir in fet there was this ques that max motile sperms are obtained from what method
